Database of galactic novae

Full description is at [`https://www.projectpluto.com/galnovae/galnovae.htm`](https://www.projectpluto.com/galnovae/galnovae.htm).

This is a complete list of galactic novae (for our galaxy;  nothing in the Magellanic Clouds
or other galaxies).  It should be passably current,  but may lag a week or two.
Feel free to nudge me (by raising an issue or by e-mailing plútö@prôjéctplüto.çom,
minus diacritical marks) if you see problems.
