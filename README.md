Database of galactic novae

Full description is at [`https://www.projectpluto.com/galnovae/galnovae.htm`](https://www.projectpluto.com/galnovae/galnovae.htm).

This is a complete list of galactic novae (nothing in the Magellanic Clouds
or other galaxies).  It should be passably current,  but may lag slightly.
Feel free to nudge me (by raising an issue) if you see problems.
