Results of a quick comparison of the first few lines of the AAVSO
list of novae with that compiled by John Greaves and me,  plus some
later notes.  At the bottom of this file is a version history.

N Cam 1999 : lightcurve data are at
    https://skydot.lanl.gov/nsvs/star.php?num=1037109&mask=15636 <https://skydot.lanl.gov/nsvs/star.php?num=1037109&mask=15636
    Also see Greaves, J., The Astronomer Magazine, Volume 43, Number 509,
    p.133 (if you can find it;  appears not to be on line).

V529 Ori = N Ori 1678 according to our data, 1667 according to AAVSO.
    JG notes its "alternative designation" as "N Ori 1667 (!)".  IAU
    list gives the date as 1678 Mar 28.

WY Sge = N Sge 1793, found by d'Agelet, mag 6, according to our data;
    1793, d'Agilet (D'Agelet?), 5.4 according to AAVSO;  1783 according to
    IAU list.  However,  I've found various sources stating that d'Agelet
    died in 1788;  see,  for example,
    http://www.archive.org/stream/memoirsofnationa01nati/memoirsofnationa01nati_djvu.txt
    which describes d'Agelet taking part in an ill-fated French scientific
    expedition around the world in 1785;  also,
    http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1951ApJ...113..320W/0000321.000.html
    gives positions and magnitudes observed by d'Agelet on 26, 27,  and 29
    July,  1783.  So I'm switching our file over to read 1783 as well.

T Boo = N Boo 1860:  GCVS puts it at RA 14 14 01.86, dec +19 04 03.5
    AAVSO at                      RA 14 14 05.7,  dec +19 04 02.
    I think GCVS is right here.  There is a faint star at that position
    in DSS and B1.0 (with B1=17.75, R1=16.25, B2=19.52, R2=20.73,
    I=17.27) and no star at the AAVSO location.

Removed this line on 2014 Feb 22 :

N Lac 1986    1986 11 22 glint N Lac 1986   22 04 06       +48 28                   8      <21                N?                      Honda                                     4275  4276

   ...because IAUC 4276 makes it likely it's not a "real" nova.  Possibly
a transient object.

N Per 1887 = 1887 V Per:  we put it at mag 9.2,  AAVSO at mag 4.0

Recurrent novae,  as listed by Bradley Schaefer in
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJS..187..275S
(plus some not-comprehensive updates mentioning some events
since this was written).

RR Tel is listed as an 1898 event in 'nova_list.htm' (at
   http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/iau/nova_list.html ),  and its discovery
   by W. Fleming matches this.  In our file,  we had it as (1948).  Maybe
   that's a re-explosion?

   Eight objects are in "our" list that do not appear in 'novalist.htm' at all:

V407 Cyg re-erupted 2010 Mar 10.

   IAU list shows N Cyg 2008 = V2468 Cyg as discovered on 2008 01 07.801,  but
IAU Circular 8927 shows it as discovered in March.

   N Aql 2015 = V1831 Aql discovered by Koichi Itagaki on 2015 10 05.548 at
unfiltered mag 12.4 (the way I listed it) and by ASAS-SN at mag 15.2V on
2015 oct 1.29,  reported by B. J. Shappee et. al.  Take your pick.

   added V339 Del = N Del 2013, N Sco 2013, V809 Cep = N Cep 2013;
   added columns for month/day and filled them for 2010-2013 novae,
   and eliminated duplicate blank columns in RA and dec.  New data
   came from http://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Koji.Mukai/novae/novae.html,
   since the IAU list hasn't been updated since 2010.
      Also added some month/date data from the IAU list for 2005
      to 2010 objects.  I found V1213 Cen in the IAU list,  but
      not in this one;  and found V1212 Cen in this list,  but not
      the IAU one.  Dunno why... I've added V1213 to this list.)
(2013 Sep 9: added N Lib 1955, N Boo 1962, N Lac 1986,  and N Vel 1990

(2013 Nov 10:  added N Aql 2013 = V2830 Aql.)
(2013 Nov 29:  corrected above '2830 Aql' to '1830 Aql';  added some of
   V556 Ser = N Ser 2013,  but need to fill in more data)
(2013 Dec 22:  updated N Cen, Aql, Ser from Koji Mukai and AAVSO data.  IM
   Nor appears twice in the IAU list,  once for 1920 and once for 2002.  I
   corrected references by hand.  The position given in the IAU list for 2002,
   15 39 26.61 -52 19 18.6,  is a few arcseconds away from "our" position.)
(2014 Feb 15:  added N Sgr 2014)
(2014 Feb 22:  added lots of IAUC references.  Removed N Lac 1986,  due to
   comments in IAUC 4276;  see deleted entry in 'galnovae.err'.)
(2014 Mar 11:  added N Cep 2014)
(2014 Apr 10:  added N Cyg 2014 and N Sco 2014)
2014 Apr 16:  added The Astronomer's Telegram refs back to 5525
2014 Oct 1: added IAUC xref and GCVS identifier to N Cyg 2014 = V2659 Cyg
2015 Mar 11:  added Novae Sco & Sgr 2015
2015 Mar 18:  added N Sgr 2015/2
2015 Apr 3:  added PNV and TCP references,  causing the 'obscure XID' field
   to become wider.  Added N Oph 2015.  Separated comments from the actual
   data file.  Switched order to show the most recent novae first.
2015 Jul 29:  added new GCVS desigs and some variable types for 13 novae
   for 2013-2015 from http://www.astronet.ru/db/varstars/msg/1338756 ,
   "Novae and Nova-like Stars in the 81th Name-list of Variable Stars:
   Official Announcement of GCVS Names."
2015 Aug 2:  added references for IAUCs 9273-9275,  brought ATel refs up
   to date.
2015 Sep 5:  brought ATels up to 7986
2015 Sep 30:  added N Sgr 2015/3 = V5669 Sgr,  brought ATels up to 8110.
2015 Oct 10:  added N Aql 2015 = V1831 Aql,  brought ATels up to 8142
2015 Oct 16:  added N Oph 2015/2,  brought ATels up to 8177
2015 Oct 29:  added V2949 Oph desig for N Oph 2015/2,  brought ATels up to 8225
2015 Nov 06:  added N Sgr 2015/4,  brought ATels up to 8250
2015 Nov 30:  brought ATels up to 8344
2016 Mar 19:  added N Oph 2016 = V3661 Oph
2016 Jun 20:  added N Sco 2016,  brought ATels up to 9187
2016 Aug 13:  added N Sgr 2016 = TCP J18010780-2631434.  Note that AAVSO
   Alert Notice 547 refers to this as 'N Sgr 2016 No. 2'.  They reach that
   conclusion by considering OGLE-2016-NOVA-02,  located at RA=17 49 57.33,
   dec=-29 15' 37.9",  to be Nova Sgr 2016 No. 1.  Dunno if I agree with them
   on that point,  so at least for the nonce,  I don't have a "No. 2" for this.
   CBAT labelled it "Nova in Sagittarius",  possibly as a way of saying "we
   haven't decided whether it's the first or second of the year either."
   There's a reported spectrum that says OGLE-2016-NOVA-02 is really a
   classical nova (ATel 9250),  but no confirmation of that.
2016 Sep 16:  added N Sco 2016/2 = PNV J17225112-3158349.
2016 Oct 02:  added N Lup 2016,  ATel xrefs to 9583
2016 Dec 28:  ATel xrefs to 9906 (no new ones)
2017 Feb 6:  Koji Mukai sorted out,  using the text from IAUC 9284,  the
   mess of designations for 2016 novae in Sagittarius
   (https://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/Koji.Mukai/novae/novae.html).  However,  he
   points out that it's still a bit muddled,  and recommends not using the
   Nova Sgr 2016 No. x designations;  use the (much less ambiguous) variable
   designations or discovery names.  In rough agreeement with this,  I've
   added a ? to the 2016 Sagittarius novae designations.
2017 Feb 26:  added N Sco 2017 = V1657 Sco;  expanded cross-refs to allow
   for five-digit IAUC and Astronomer's Telegrams (this object referenced
   AT 10071,  which wouldn't have fitted).  Adjusted the .idf and .tdf
   files to reflect that change.
2017 Apr 21:  N Sgr 2016/4 = PNV J18205200-2822100 is now a.k.a. V5856 Sgr.
   Added ref to IAUC 9286.
2017 May 03: added a few references,  including ATels up to 10345
2017 May 15: added TCP J17394608-2457555 = N Oph 2017
2017 May 22:  added ASASSN-17gk,  ATel xrefs to 10412
2017 Jul 2: added ASASSN-17hx = ASASSN-17ib,  ATel xrefs to 10552
2017 Aug 8: ATel xrefs to 10625
2017 Sep 29:  added various object,  AAVSO Alerts to 598 (special alerts
   have been discontinued),  ATels to 10801
2017 Nov 18:  added N Oph 2017/2,  brought ATel and Alerts up to date
2017 Jan 26:  added first three novae of 2018
2017 Mar 23:  added N Car 2018.  Four other 2018 novae were added previously
   without being noted here.
2017 Mar 27:  added N CMa 2018.
2017 Apr 21:  added new Sagittarius nova (is 'new nova' redundant?) and many
   new variable star designations and nova classes from
2018 May 2:  added V392 Per,  some references

   http://www.astronet.ru/db/varstars/msg/1395385

2018 Jun 6:  added N Lup 2018
2019 Jan 21:  added AAVSO Alert Notices to 658,  Astronomer's Telegrams to 12414
2019 Jan 31:  added GCVS names,  nova types,  max/min mags from Peremennye
Zvezdy 38, No. 5, 2018,  for fourteen galactic novae discovered in 2018 :

http://www.astronet.ru/db/varstars/msg/1452269

They're marked with reference PZ38/5.

2019 May 13:  John Greaves supplied a reference (IAUC 8014) for "N Cep 2001",
   and pointed out that it and N Cam 1999 are not officially sanctioned
   designations.  I added a question mark to both desigs,  and noted that
   N Cam 1999 = NSVS 1037109.
2019 May 29 : added N Sco 2019
2019 Aug 18 : added N Ori 2019 = V2860 Ori
